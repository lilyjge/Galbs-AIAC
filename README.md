## Installation

TODO.

Note: On MacOS, `portaudio` must be installed with `brew install portaudio` prior to installing the python requirements.txt, or else
`ERROR: Failed building wheel for pyaudio` will occur.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

### Run server

Run the server on the local network with `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`.

## Contact

TODO (if we want to put our details here).
